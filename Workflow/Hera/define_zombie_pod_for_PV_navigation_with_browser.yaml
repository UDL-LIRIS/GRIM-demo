## Zombie pod that has no other purpose than allowing to navigate
# with a web browser within the directory-tree/files that this volume
# gathered after being used by some argo workflow (using that PVC) execution.
# Note: the pod gets launched but the (nginx) http server won't be visible
# from anywhere (both intranet and extranet) because PaGoDa doesn't expose it.
